## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

After a few months of working in React, I wanted to try a build in vanilla JavaScript. I realized I am a little rusty, so I used pretty repetitive code in order to toggle between Daily, Weekly, and Monthly views. I continued to hone my Flexbox and CSS Grid skills, and learned that giving grid items a fixed width or height can actually have unwanted side effects in responsivity.

### Continued development

I really wanted to use JavaScript to fetch the JSON document and import values in my app. I didn't reach the outcome I was hoping for, however. So I want to continue learning about how to achieve this. I'm hoping that when I build this out again in React, I will gain some insight that can help me refactor this code.
